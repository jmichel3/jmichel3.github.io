<p>I crawl through a crinkled shirt and adorn my neck with my never-washed skinny black TJ Maxx tie. I donâ€™t know who I am; at first glance my reflection is a young man headed to church with a level head informed by the gospel, but a closer look reveals boyish wrinkles and creases that stifle my attempts at adulthood. I need a damn iron.</p>
