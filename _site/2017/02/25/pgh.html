<blockquote>
  <p>Of course Pittsburgh was colder and wearier than Oakland, but it wasnâ€™t any filthier. What it seemed to lack that Oakland had was a sky. By day it looked like old newspapers had been pasted over the sun, and after dark the universe ended six feet above the tallest lamp. There were no dawns or sunsets in Pittsburgh; there were no heavens in which they might occur.</p>
