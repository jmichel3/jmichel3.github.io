Distractions dance in browser tabs above this window, pulling this sheet of a screen all which ways. Sometimes I lose my grip and it billows upward -- a bare mattress underneath with cushioned ridges that are alien. Plush dunes in a desert of searching. Lord I want to stand there, miniscule and wandering extraterrestrial heaps if it means a holy awe for my parched soul. Help me find the oasis, the urine stain of 15 years ago of the child scared in the night, his bodily grounding that yes, I'm in reality, not a nightmare. He's growing, he'll soon be too old for this, the ignominious lesson.
