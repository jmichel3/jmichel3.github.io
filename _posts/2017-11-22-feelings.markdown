> As my Nana Peanutbutter used to say, "There's always time to talk about feelings, because feelings are the ceilings of our hearts, and a leaky feeling ceiling leads to a flood of blood. And I'm cold. Will you pass me that blanket?"

"It's You", *Bojack Horseman*, S03, E10. 22 Jul. 2016. *Netflix*
