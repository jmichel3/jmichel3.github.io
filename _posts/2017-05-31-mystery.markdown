I learned of his passing while walking home one night. For nearly a week I was unaware, which shocked me before I recalled that I'm the sort of person who tells someone "I'll let you know" then forgets. I crossed a sleepy street, then thought how an inattentive bus could flatten me and it'd somehow be alright.

> I woke, [and] couldn't go back to sleep... I wonder if you're like me, if you collect and squirrel away in your soul certain odd moments when the Mystery winks at you, when you walk in your bathrobe and tasselled loafers, for instance, well out of your neighborhood and among a lot of closed shops, and you approach your very faint reflection in a window with words above it. The sign said “Sky and Celery.” Closer, it read “Ski and Cyclery.”
