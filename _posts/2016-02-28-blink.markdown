Saturday night of the weekend before spring break and I break things, snared by a fake, fake person who's very real, just in a screen. Now burning breath emblazons my blackened lids. I'm beleaguered. I bemoan my inability to become belligerent for a beautiful body with mutual belonging, bathing in blankets, back and forth, breezes at the tails of the beach. I'm pathetic; blight steers me all which ways, though primarily hell-bound which is existential and real and unfathomable. You can get lost in the fact that you're living as easily as you can walk down the street and be tricked into thinking you're in a rush.
