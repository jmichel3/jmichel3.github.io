I loved watching Modern Family with you last Friday night mom while you nodded off and I slowly downed more than a couple beers. In the spirit of my jovial buzz, I saw the beauty in Cam and whats-his-name's relationship because I'm not a bigoted conservative Christian. I was uncomfortable from sitting on the carpet but I beheld its colored patches we'd faded. Leaning to one side, I laughed at the TV then looked back for agreement but she's now asleep like she usually is, and Romeo the cat is stretched and elongated like he usually is, and I feel comfy but depressed but transcendent like I usually do.
